_Originally written for TWiki, previously known as !GenHTMLAddOn, !PublishAddOn, and !PublishContrib, this is the most complete publishing solution for Foswiki._

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/publish.gif" style="float:right" />
!PublishPlugin provides support for the generation of stand-alone HTML from a web. It will generate fully rendered versions of a set of Foswiki pages together with any attached files.

%TOC%
<script type="text/javascript">
function showPublishOptions() {
    var select = document.getElementsByClassName('selectedFormat');
    var chosen = select[0].value + 'Options';
    var options = document.getElementsByClassName('publishOptionsSet');
    for (var i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {
        if (options[i].className.indexOf(chosen) >= 0)
            options[i].style.display = 'block';
        else
            options[i].style.display = 'none';
    }
}
</script>
When you want to read a document stored in Foswiki, you have to have access to the web server that hosts that document. There are times when this may not be desirable, or even possible. For example:
	1 Foswiki is used to create documentation which has to be readable off-line
	1 Published versions of Foswiki pages must be read-only
	1 The Foswiki server is inaccessible to the audience (e.g. on the other side of a corporate firewall)
	1 You want to put product documentation on a CD
The PublishPlugin supports the generation of several different read-only document formats from Foswiki pages, including HTML and PDF.

---++ Features
	* All standard Foswiki macros are interpreted
	* Plugins are called
	* Unresolved links to non-existent topics are silently ignored
	* Topic links internal to the wiki are translated to relative links
	* Powerful support for choosing what content gets published
	* Any links to the 'pub' areas of topics in the web are automatically resolved and the referenced files copied
	* Any links to images outside the wiki are resolved, and the image is stored in the output (requires LWP)
	* Output in HTML or PDF. HTML can be compressed in different archive formats.
	* Full support for hierarchical webs
	* Multiple instances (e.g. dev, test, prod) can be specified
	* Special output format specific templates (such as viewpdf) can be used
	* Able to publish HTML and referenced files directly to a remote server via ftp
    * Complete history of what was published, and when!

---++ Usage
---+++ Publish Form
The easiest way to publish a web is from this topic, by filling in the following form.

The output is generated in a directory designated during installation. The progress messages printed during documentation generation tell you exactly where the output is. Admins can use the PublishPluginControlCentre to manage the published output.

Publishing is an access-controlled process; before you can publish, you have to have VIEW access to the topics you want to publish, and CHANGE access to the publishing history topic.

You can also create a [[#PublishTopic][permanent topic in a web]] to help with a repeated publishing process.

#WildcardPattern
---+++ Wildcard Patterns
Wildcard patterns are well known to people who are used to command lines on computers, but may be unfamiliar to the Windows generation. A wildcard is a special string that you can put into a filename so that it matches a whole range of files:
| *String* | *What  it does* | *Example* | *What the example matches* |
| * | Matches any string, including an empty string. | =*Cheese*= | Every topic with "Cheese" somewhere in the name (but _not_ "cheese") |
| ? | Matches any single character. | Example1? | Example10 and Example 1X but _not_ example1 |
| [...] | Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range  expression; any  character that sorts between those two characters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched.  If the first character following the [ is a ^ then any character not enclosed is matched. A - may be matched by including it as the first or  last  character  in  the set.  A ] may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.<br /> Within  [  and ], character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:], where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX.2 standard: =alnum=, =alpha=, =ascii=, =blank=, =cntrl=, =digit=, =graph=, =lower=, =print=, =punct=, =space=, =upper=, =word=, =xdigit=. A character class matches any character belonging to that class.  The =word= character class matches letters, digits, and the character _. | B[aeiou]g | Bag, Bog, Big, Beg, Bug |

#RegularExpression
---+++ Regular Expressions
A perl regular expression. You can use a simple string here, which will be matched exactly, or you can read up on perl regular expressions on the web. 

#PublishTopic
---+++ Using a Publish Topic (configtopic)
You can create a publish topic in a web that contains all the details needed to publish that web. This is just a topic with a series of standard preference settings (which correspond to the form parameters) in it. You can use the PublishWeb topic in this web as a template for your own topics.

Alternatively you can just take a copy of the form in this topic, paste it into your own topic, and change the defaults.

To use a publish topic, you must pass the =configtopic= parameter to the =publish= script set to the name of the topic to use to control publishing. You can specify a topic in another web using the standard Web.Topic syntax.

---+++ Publishing from the command line
Just =cd= to the =bin= directory, and
=perl -T rest /PublishPlugin/publish=. Parameters are passed as name=value pairs, for example:
<verbatim>
perl -T rest /PublishPlugin/publish web=Book exclusions='Web*' format=file
perl -T rest /PublishPlugin/publish web=Book inclusions=WebBook format=pdf extras='--book --duplex --toclevels=5'
</verbatim>
The available parameter names are shown in the publish form above, in the last column.

---+++ Controlling which parts of a topic get published
You can control what gets published from a topic using =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= control tags:
   * If =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= is the first control tag seen in the file, everything before it will be ignored.
   * Everything between =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= and the next =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= (or the end of the topic) will be ignored.
   * =%<nop>STARTPUBLISH%= and =%<nop>STOPPUBLISH%= will be visible in the viewed topic, so you can easily see what will be published from the topic.
Note: the old &lt;nopublish> tag is deprecated and should be replaced in topics

Another good trick is to set up a special "publishing" web. Create topics in the web that %INCLUDE the topics from *other* webs that you want to publish. You can use [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarSTARTSECTION][STARTSECTION]] and [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarENDSECTION][ENDSECTION]] to highlight what you want published. This way the "publishing" web gives you a view of exactly what will be in the published output, without the need for special publishing tags.

---++ Publishing History
Every time a web is published, then the results of that publishing step are stored in a topic in the web. By default this topic is called =PublishPluginHistory=, but you can choose another name (see the form, above). In order to publish a web, you have to be able to write to this topic. If you need to add access controls to the topic, then make sure you do that right at the beginning of the topic, or in the hidden preferences.

The history topics contains a list of all the parameters used, and the versions of the topics that were published, so it is very useful for tracking exactly what you publish. it is written every time you run =publish=.

---++ Installation Instructions
---+++ Dependencies

Note: If you want to generate PDF files, you will need an installation of =htmldoc=. This program is available from http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/ for free, but you are *strongly* recommended to buy the commercial version. Your support for open-source projects helps make open-source software possible.

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

Run =configure= and complete the installation in the *PublishPlugin* section.

---++++ =PDF= output
   1 install htmldoc from http://www.easysw.com/htmldoc/

Note that =htmldoc= can also be used to generate !PostScript by using the =-t= option in the =Other output generator options= above. See the =htmldoc= man pages for details.

---++++ =.tgz= (tar) output
   1 Install Archive::Tar and everything it depends on

---++++ =.zip= output
   1 Install Archive::Zip and everything it depends on

*WARNING!* Anything published is no longer under the
control of Foswiki access controls, and if you make the publish output
directory visible on the web then you may need to
take precautions to prevent accidental leakage of confidential information
by restricting web access to this directory, for example in the Apache
configuration.

---++ Info
This add-on started life as the !GenHTMLAddon, written by Foswiki:Main/CrawfordCurrie at Motorola. It was then extended by Eric Scouten, and then further fixed and enhanced by Foswiki:Main/CrawfordCurrie (http://c-dot.co.uk). It has also been extended by Foswiki:Main/SvenDowideit and Foswiki:Main/MartinCleaver, and most recently refactored for Foswiki by Foswiki:Main/CrawfordCurrie.
